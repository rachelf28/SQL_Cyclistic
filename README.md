## Analysing New York bike data to understand key differences between Casual Riders and Subscribers

This project aims to understand the New York Citi Bike data available in Google BigQuery's public datasets.

The business question we're trying to answer through this analysis is: How much do Casual Riders and Members differ? The aim is to support a hypothetical marketing team understand what initiatives they can take to turn Casual Riders into Members as the business has deemed the latter to be more profitable in the long run.
