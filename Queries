-- Where 1 - Sunday, 2 - Monday, 3 - Tuesday, 4 - Wednesday, 5 - Thursday, 6 - Friday, 7 - Saturday

-- Overall, the weekend sees fewer rides when compared to the rest of the week. Wednesday, Thursday, and Tuesday see the highest number
-- of daily rides. But how does this differ when comparing casual riders and members?

-- First, let's look at customers (those who purchase 24-hour passes). Let's also look at percentages as these will be easier to understand.

SELECT 
    EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK from starttime),
    ROUND(COUNT(tripduration) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(tripduration)) OVER (),0) AS Percentage
From `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE usertype = 'Customer'
GROUP BY EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK from starttime)
ORDER BY Percentage DESC;

-- We can see that the weekend - Saturday and Sunday in that order - see the highest number of rides.

-- On the other hand, Members with annual subscriptions tend to ride less on the weekends and more during the week.
-- There is also a more even spread throughout the week, with the percentage points remaining quite stable.
-- Comparing these two sets of results shows us that Customers are users who may use the day pass to ride the bikes as a weekend hobbie
-- whereas Subscribers are more likely to be working professionals who have a Monday-Friday schedule.
